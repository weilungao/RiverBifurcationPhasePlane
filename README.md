# RiverBifurcationPhasePlane
Matlab code for analyzing the full phase plane for river bifurcation, adopting different nodal-point relations and sediment transport formulas.
Wang et al. (1995)'s and Bolla Pittaluga et al. (2003)'s nodal-point relations and EH and MPM sediment transport formulas were adopted.
